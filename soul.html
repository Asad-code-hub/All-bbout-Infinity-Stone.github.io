    <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">The Soul Stone</h1>
    <P>In Infinity War, Thanos travels with Gamora to the planet Vormir, where the Soul Stone is kept. There they encounter Red Skull, the villain from the first Captain America movie, who has been doomed to guard but not use the Soul Stone after trying to handle the Space Stone himself. Red Skull tells Thanos that he needs to sacrifice something he loves to attain the gem, and Thanos kills Gamora.

        It’s unclear what the Soul Stone’s powers are in the film universe. In the comics, the gem allows the holder to capture and control others’ souls. It also creates a separate universe where the person who wields it can trip souls. It’s possible that the people who turned to dust at the end of Infinity War may simply reside in this alternate universe created by the stone.
        
        Why are all these stones in some sort of container?
        You can’t hold an Infinity Stone for very long without dying. Just look at what happened to Red Skull. That’s why the Time Stone is in a necklace, the Mind Stone in a scepter, the Space Stone in the Tesseract, etc. Thanos needs to wear a special golden glove to hold all the stones.</P>
