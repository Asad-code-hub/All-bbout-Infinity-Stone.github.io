      <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">Everything to Know About Marvel’s Infinity Stonest</h1>
      <P>Captain Marvel chases after the Tesseract, the Guardians of the Galaxy steal an orb, Thor tries to capture Aether. These magical objects may seem like MacGuffins, or simply plot devices that are meant to keep the Marvel Cinematic Universe moving forward. But in fact, these objects are Infinity Stones: a group of gems that grant their owner great power. Thanos, an evil, purple alien, used that power to destroy half the universe in Avengers: Infinity War. Now, in the Infinity War sequel, Avengers: Endgame, it’s up to Marvel’s heroes to reverse that damage, possibly by traveling through time and acquiring and destroying all the Infinity Stones themselves before Thanos can get his hands on them. The complex Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline makes it easy to forget the Infinity Stone names, let alone their powers and where you might have seen them before. After all, there are 21 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And most of the Infinity Stones have multiple names. But we’ve got you covered. Here are answers to all of your questions about the Infinity Stones</P>
      <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">So what’s an Infinity Stone, again?</h1>
      <P>Infinity Stones are really powerful gems that, when united, can be used to destroy people, planets, solar systems—you name it.</P>
      <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">How many Infinity Stones are there?</h1>
      <P>There are six Infinity Stones: The Space Stone (blue), the Reality Stone (red), the Power Stone (purple), the Mind Stone (yellow), the Time Stone (green) and the Soul Stone (orange).

    </P>
    <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">Where did the Infinity Stones come from?</h1>
    <P>As Benicio Del Toro’s The Collector explains in Guardians of the Galaxy, six singularities existed before the creation of the Universe. The Big Bang transformed those entities into six separate Infinity Stones.</P>
    <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">Where have I seen the Infinity Stones before?</h1>
    <P>So glad you asked. This can get confusing because many of these stones have two different names. Here’s a rundown of all the Infinity Stone names and what movies they’ve popped up in.</P>
    
    <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">Description</h1> 
    <P>Each Gem is shaped like a small oval[25] and is named after, and represents, a different characteristic of existence.[citation needed] Possessing any single Gem grants the user the ability to command whatever aspect of existence the Gem represents.[citation needed] The Gems are not immutable.[26] For instance, on two occasions, one or more of the Gems have appeared as deep pink spheres several feet in diameter,[3][27] while on other occasions, the Gems have appeared in their small oval shape but with different coloring. (e.g. the Soul Gem being colored red when worn by the Gardener).[28] In the Ultraverse, after merging into their original form of Nemesis, the Gems were again separated after a battle with Ultraforce and the Avengers.[29] As part of the Marvel Legacy initiative, the Infinity Gems (now known as the Infinity Stones), had their colors altered to match the colors of the Infinity Stones from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</P>
