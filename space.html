    <h1 class="display-4 font-italic">The Space Stone (The Tesseract)</h1>
    <P>The Space Stone gives the user power over space. Anyone holding the Space Stone can create a portal from one part of the universe to another. In the Marvel films, the Space Stone is hidden inside a blue cube called the Tesseract.

    The evil organization HYDRA used the Tesseract to power their weapons during World War II in Captain America: The First Avenger, but the Tesseract fell out of a plane being piloted by Captain America at the end of that movie. We find out the government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recovered the Tesseract from the plane during the end credits of Thor.
    
    In Captain Marvel, which is set in the 1990s, a Kree scientist named Mar-Vell (Annette Bening) harnesses the power of the Tesseract to create an engine that can power ships to travel at light speed. Before Mar-Vell is killed by her own people, she hides the Tesseract on a ship in space. Carol Danvers (a.k.a. Captain Marvel, played by Brie Larson) recovers the Tesseract, and her feline sidekick Goose (who is actually an alien called a Flerken) carries it to the office of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) at S.H.I.E.L.D.In Thor: Ragnarok, Thor realizes he must destroy Asgard to defeat the Goddess of Death, Hela (Cate Blanchett). As he and a cohort of sidekicks fight Hela, a supposedly reformed Loki sneaks down to the treasure room where the Tesseract (and therefore the Space Stone) is kept. We never see him grab the stone, but that dude just cannot resist creating chaos. He probably pocketed it. In the post-credit scenes for Thor: Ragnarok, we find out that someone attacked Thorâ€™s getaway ship. In Infinity War, Thanos kills Loki and takes the Space Stone.</P>
